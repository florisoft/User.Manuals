# Manual PDA configuration

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the PDA configuration manual. This manual describes the steps neccesary to setup a remote desktop connection (RDP) to a server running Florisoft.

PDA's are widely used in combination with Florisoft for severval purposes like mobile selling, scanning barcodes at an entrance control location, sort/locate products in a warehouse and performing final checks on products to be supplied to customers.

To get this done, a connection between the PDA and the server must be made. In most cases this is done via a remote desktop connection. To get this working serveral settings on the PDA and the server need to be set up correctly.

Those settings depends on the type of device you are using in combination with the server. Below several types of devices are described in combination with several server setups.

After this introduction, the Skorpio X5 is the first device which is described in combination with several server set ups.

Thereafter the same explanation is written out for a Zebra TC25 PDA.

## 2. Setup environment settings
Due to security reasons it is desirable that a PDA user only has access to the Florisoft software. The rest of the server must be restricted so the user has less chance to damage other parts of the server.

To get this done certain settings need to be set on the (domain)user accounts of the PDA users.

1. Log into the environment (server) where the user accounts are defined. In most cases this will be a machine which acts as a domain controller.<br>

2. Open the concerning PDA user, eg. PDA01 or HT11 by double clicking on its name. The users' Properties windows open. See the screenshot below:<br>

![](images/2023-08-03-15-50-02.png)

3. Navigate to the Account tab. (no. 1)<br>

4. Fill in the username in the User logon name: field. (no. 2)<br>

5. Select the concerning domain in the adjacent dropdown. (no. 3)<br>

6. Fill in the correct domain in the User logon name (pre-Windows 2000): field (no. 4)

How to know the correct domain name? This depends on the type of cloud environment. See below for the most common cloud environments that are used in combination with Florisoft:

**Reset:** FPC\
**Reset (private cloud):** FSPC\
**Axxon:** FLORISOFTCLOUD\
**Auton:** FLORICLOUD\
**BMP:** FLORISOFT-CLOUD

7. Fill in the value [username_customercode] in the adjacent field. (no. 5)<br>

8. Check the Password never expires tick in the Account options section. (no. 6)<br> 

9. Click the Environment tab. (no. 7)<br>

![](images/2023-08-03-16-22-52.png)

10. Tick the Start the following program at logon: checkmark. (no. 8)<br>

11. Fill in the correct path to the concerning florisoft 2000.exe in the Program file name: field. (no. 9)

>**Pay attention: please add the /U: and /P: parameters after the closing double apostrophe behind florisoft 2000.exe. Give them the Florisoft username and password as values. This ensures that this Windows user is linked to a specific PDA user in Florisoft.**

The default way of working with PDA's in Florisoft is to give them their own client folder. In most cases the client folder for PDA's is called something like FSNETHT, FSNETPDA, or one of those names followed by a serial number like FSNETHT01, FSNETPDA02, etc. (no. 10)

12. Fill in the Start in field (no. 11) the same value as in the Program file name field (no. 9) but remove everyting after Splash\.<br>

13. Click the Apply button (no. 12) to confirm the settings.<br>

14. Click the OK button (no. 13) to close the users properties window.

Repeat the steps two up and till fourteen for every PDA user which is available on the server.

>**Pay attention: sometimes it is neccesary to add some registry keys to the RDS as well as the domain controller to automaticlly start exe's like Florisoft. This can only be done by experienced IT personel. This only applies from Windows Server 2019 and upwards.**
