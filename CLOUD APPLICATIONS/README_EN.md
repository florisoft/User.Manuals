### Explanation  
The visual below shows how the different Florisoft Apps are organized across various functional domains, such as *Core Services*, *Sales*, *Inventory*, and *Logistics*.  
For each app, the corresponding **use cases** are displayed, giving you a clear overview of which processes are supported by which app. 

## Licenses

To use the Florisoft Apps, a valid license is required.  
License verification takes place automatically via the cloud server.  
Without a valid license, the apps will not start or will operate with limited functionality.

New licenses or modifications to existing ones can be requested via [Florisoft Support](https://www.florisoft.nl/contact)

## Policy Usage

All settings within the Florisoft Apps are centrally managed through policies in the backoffice. This ensures a uniform and manageable configuration of the apps, tailored to the specific workflows of your organization. Policy scenarios play a crucial role here: they determine how the app behaves in different contexts.

More information about setting up and managing policies can be found in the manual:
[Policy Management Manual](https://github.com/florisoft/User.Manuals/blob/main/BASIS/Policy%20Management/Manual%20Policy%20Management%20EN.md)


## Printing Functionality and Job Agent

For printing documents via Florisoft Apps, a separate component is required: the **Job Agent**. This ensures that print jobs from the apps are correctly forwarded to the linked printers within your network.

The Job Agent runs on a Windows environment and requires one-time configuration.

More information and installation instructions can be found in the manual:

## Support

Florisoft offers various forms of support when using the apps:

> **Note:** In some cases, an app is set up via a consultant. In that case, all communication and support will go through the consultant. Only after the consultant has explicitly indicated that the handover is complete can support be contacted directly.
