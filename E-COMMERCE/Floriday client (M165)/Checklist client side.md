- Creation of a new **supplier**
    - *Constants -> Community -> supplier data -> suppliers -> ***'Insert'****
- The following settings must be turned on:
-	*Webservice -> activate for stock link ->* ***turn on checkmark***
	-	*Webservice -> Type webservice ->* ***'Floriday Koper API Express'***
	-	*Webservice -> incoming stock ->* ***'The stoch that was previously created'***
	-	*Webservice -> API key ->* ***You have to request this on the Floriday platform'***
	-	*Webservice -> Region GLN ->* ***this is the GLN code of the region (auction)***
	-	*Webservice -> Aflever GLN ->* ***This is the GLN code of the exact delivery location***  

## Alternative locations

It is possible that a grower (connection) does not deliver in a certain region where a company is located. If the company is located at several locations (Rijnsburg and Aalsmaar, for example) and the grower does deliver there, this must be stated under alternative locations. When placing an order, the delivery location that is stored with the stock lot will be used. The lot contains either the main location or the deviating location, just where the grower delivers and what the next alternative location should be.

## Operation

After a correct design, Floriday's offer can be read. This can be done by the Import lots button or automatically via the Stock link timer.

### Connections

Syncing for the first time will be the first step to retrieve the connections made with the different growers on Floriday.
These growers are then saved in Florisoft, so that the next synchronization does not have to do this again.
With new connections or disconnected connections, this will be performed again, but only for the changes.

### Process offer

The first synchronization will collect the offer per grower and process it directly within Florisoft per grower. The next synchronization will only fetch and process the updates of the offer from the existing offer.
Lots are only created within Florisoft if a grower actually delivers to the specified regions.

### Offer

Within the Floriday online environment, assortment must be marked as 'favorite' at line level.
Only then will it also be included in the offer that Florisoft collects.
