# Florisoft Manual Prepaid - M199

This document deals with the implementation and operation of PrePaid purchase limits on the Florishop. Please note! Using the PrePaid wallet currently only works when using Buckaroo as the payment provider. Other providers can be added upon request.

The idea of this system is that customers can shop on the web shop only on a prepaid wallet. No purchases can be made below this, and there is also a portion that cannot be spent. A kind of "collateral" or "prepaid minimum credit. One wishes to be able to raise this prepaid credit on the webshop directly, via prepayments. In the back office this is configurable per customer (debtor), and the payments made on the webshop can eventually be shown here. After these have been processed.

## How to configure this in the back office?

*Follow the steps below:*

|Step|Explanation|
|:-:|:--|
|**1**|Configure the debtor as a Pre-Paid customer, we can do this in the constants screen path:<br>**Community→Debtor data→Debtors**<br>Open a debtor and navigate to:<br>**Internet→Koop limiet** (Purchase limit in Dutch)<details><summary><b>Click here for the example image!</b></summary><img src="Pre Paid Kooplimiet/EN/image1.png"></details>|
|**2**|When this setting is enabled you should get a alert prompt if someone tries to manually alter the purchase limit. You should **NOT** change the purchase limit once it has been set in a Pre-paid customer.<br><br>The '*Minimum prepaid credit (base deposit)*' is the base limit that can't be spent. This is deducted directly from the total credit, and does not show up in the purchase limit, but can be shown on the web shop.<br><br>In short enable the setting "*Webshop payment method as 'Pre paid', based on payments*" and an **optional** step is to set a minimum prepaid credit.<br><br>Het totale betaalde bedrag wat nog niet is verwerkt door het systeem (via de webshop), of dit nu een ‘vooruit’ betaling was of niet, wordt in het kooplimiet verwerkt. Dit verwerken gebeurt dan wel direct bij het betalen via de payment gateway op de webshop, dan wel op de Timer PREPAIDTEGOEDBEPALEN. <details><summary><b>Click here for the example image!</b></summary><img src="Pre Paid Kooplimiet/EN/image2.png"></details>|
