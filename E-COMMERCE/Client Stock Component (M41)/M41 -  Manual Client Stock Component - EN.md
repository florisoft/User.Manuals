## Creating a supplier

A stock connection requires two things a stock and a supplier. In this chapter the process of creating a supplier is explained. If you already created a supplier for this connection you may start the steps below at step 6.

|Step|Explanation|

|**1**|Open the constants screen.<details><summary><b>Clik here for your example image</b></summary><img src=".Stock connection manual/media/image1.png"></details>|

|**8**|Open the folder called '*Webservice*' in the left side of the screen and navigate to the subfolder '*Parcel request*'.|
|**9**|Enable the checkbox '*Always get full stock instead of modifications*'. This only needs to done once as we need to disable this checkbox again later on in this manual.<details><summary><b>Clik here for your example image</b></summary><img src=".Stock connection manual/media/image11.png"></details>||
|**10**|Navigate to the subfolder '*Parcel response*'|
|**11**|In this screen you'll need to change the follow settings:<br>- **Default Articlegroup**: Set it to this '*Nieuw artikel (000000001)*' (New article in Dutch)
|**12**|Click on **Ok** to confirm the made changes for the supplier. Reopen the supplier by clicking on twice on its row.
|**13**|Navigate back to the folder '*Webservice*'. After having filled out the previous fields correctly you should now be able to click on the button **Receive parcels**|
|**14**|After pressing this button, a second screen (Events logger) will appear. Florisoft will now read all parcels, **DO NOT** interact with Florisoft during this process. Once its done a new screen should appear, see the example image below.<details><summary><b>Clik here for your example image</b></summary><img src=".Stock connection manual/media/image14.png"></details>|
|**15**|Once the process is done you should navigate back to the subfolder '*Webservice*' / '*Parcel request*'. Disable the checkbox '*Always get full stock instead of modifications*'<details><summary><b>Clik here for your example image</b></summary><img src=".Stock connection manual/media/image19.png"></details>|
|**16**|Since we have just imported the stock using the stock connection you may close the constants screen and go back to the Florisoft Navigator. Once in the navigator you should click on the '**Stocks** button. <details><summary><b>Clik here for your example image</b></summary><img src=".Stock connection manual/media/image13.png"></details>|
|**17**|When you have clicked the stocks, the newly made stock will appear in the stock list. Now when you click on the name, all imported parcels will show. When you double click on any line. An extra screen below will appear. You can add parcels there on the order list.<details><summary><b>Clik here for your example image</b></summary><img src=".Stock connection manual/media/image17.png"></details><br><br>**Watch out with putting items in the division screen for testing. If the debtor has a fast logistical process, items can actually be packed and shipped before you can remove it.**|

*Now you have succesfully installed a stock connection with a debtor. Repeat the steps to do this with other debtors.*
