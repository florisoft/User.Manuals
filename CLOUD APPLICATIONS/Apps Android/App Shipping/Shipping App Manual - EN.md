# Florisoft Shipping App Manual

This manual explains how to use and configure the Florisoft Shipping App.  
At this moment, the app only supports printing address labels. In the future, we may extend the app with additional use cases related to shipping orders.

## Address Label
With the Address Label functionality in the Shipping App, employees can quickly and accurately generate shipping labels for orders. The app supports automatic retrieval and validation of address data and can directly control connected label printers.

Labels can be enriched with barcodes, customer references, and multiple copies if needed. The functionality can be used as a standalone module or integrated into other logistical workflows within Florisoft apps.
