## Module Transport Costing

The basis of Transport Costing is the departure/delivery day system, and you can combine it with the order number system. In addition, you can set the transport costs so the customer knows what the total costs are including transport. Using a wizard, the customer can choose the desired delivery/delivery date and indicate whether something should be delivered or whether it will be picked up. <br>*By using the steps below you can get an example of the system to show*:
