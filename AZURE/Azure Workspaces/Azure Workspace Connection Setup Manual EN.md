# Florisoft Manual Azure Workspace Connection Set-Up

Welcome to the setup manual for connecting to your Florisoft Azure workspace. Azure is a virtual server (cloud) environment on which your Florisoft client is hosted. 

Before we can access your Florisoft application we will need to set-up the client that lets you connect to the Azure environment. This manual covers the initial set-up for this client.

The manual is split in two parts: installation of the client and access by authenticating in the browser. We will soon add the option to authenticate from an android device, however this is currently in development.
