## Requirements

To use this module, you will need a few things:

1. Linked payment terminal from MultiSafepay.
2. Florisoft "Payment Terminals" module.

## Configuration

To configure this module, you will need some information provided by Florisoft:

**If you need further explanation about the policy screen, please read more [here](https://github.com/florisoft/User.Manuals/blob/main/BASIS/Policy%20Management/Manual%20Policy%20Management%20EN.md).**

## Operation

The operation of this module is within the cash register screen found through the invoice tray.<br>
*Follow the steps below:*

|Step|Explanation|
|:-:|:--|
|**1**|Using a user who has set up this payment method via policies and INI, go to the Invoices screen.<br>**Navigator→Invoice**.<details><summary><b>Click here for your example!</b></summary><img src="Media/EN/9.png"></details>|
|**2**|Then, select an invoice and press the F12 key to initiate a new payment. <details><summary><b>Click here for your example!</b></summary><img src="Media/EN/10.png"></details>|
|**3**|Enter the amount to be paid (#1). |
|**4**|Next, select the previously created payment method (MultiSafepay) by pressing the button (#2).|
|**5**|Now, use the spacebar to select the invoices associated with the payment. The selected invoice numbers will then appear as a note for the transaction.|
|**6**|When you press **Ok** now, Florisoft will freeze, and you will see a payment prompt appear on the payment terminal in a few moments.|
|**7.a**|If the payment is successfully completed, you will see a confirmation prompt in Florisoft.|
|**7.b**|If the payment fails or takes too long, Florisoft will display a timeout message.|

### Troubleshooting

In the Cash & Carry screen there is an issue when creating a new payment without creating a new order first, when doing this Florisoft will always prompt a print option that prevents the PIN-payment from going through to the terminal. This issue can be addressed with a Policy-setting that stops the print-prompt from appearing when paying with a PIN-method, the setting that prevents the prompt is a policy and will thus need to be set for the corresponding policies.
