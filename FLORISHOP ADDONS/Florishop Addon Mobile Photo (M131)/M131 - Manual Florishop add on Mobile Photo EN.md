# Florisoft Manual Mobile Photo (M131)

Welcome to the manual FloriShop add on Mobile Photo. This add on is used
to add photos to products on the webshop. Usually product photos are
already linked to articles in the webshop. However, there may be
situations where some photos are not loaded or where you want to change
the default photo. The Mobile Photo add-on is required for doing this.

Before a webshop user can link photos, they must be authorized for this.
This is a setting in Florisoft. The steps for this are described in
chapter two.

Adding images manually can be done in roughly two ways. You can link an
existing image (stored on a storage device) and new images (made with a
camera on a mobile device). This process is described in chapter three.
It is possible to link images to both stock and order parcels.

Finally, chapter four describes the other add ons that are available for
the webshop. This chapter briefly describes the functionality for each
add on and the added value for your organization.

The purpose of this manual is that webshop administrators can add images
to products on the web shop themselves.

:warning:**Pay attention:** *images in this manual may differ slightly from what you
see on your own screen.*
