## Preface

The credit add-on offers web shop users (customers) the option to make credit requests through the FloriShop. Credit requests may also be supplemented with additional information when necessary.The advantage of this is that the most relevant information becomes available automatically.

:warning:
**Screenshots in this manual may differ from screens on your system due to Florisoft being continuously updated. Do note that the main process flow will remain the same.**

## Activating the required modules in Florisoft

The first step is to enable the required modules for the debtors you want to be able to create Credit requests. To enable the required modules follow the steps below:

|Step#|Explanation|
|:--|:--|
|**0**|Open the Florisoft application and log in with your user credentials.|
|**1**|In the Florisoft navigator open the constants screen (#1). <br> <details><summary>Click here to reveal the image</summary><img src="Media/image1.png"></details>|
|**2**|Within the Constants file structure navigate to the following: <br> *Community*(#1) **→** *Debtor Data*(#2) **→** *Debtors*(#3)<br> <details><summary>Click here to reveal the image</summary><img src="Media/image2.png"></details>|
|**3**|Double left click on a debtor row in the table(#4), this should open a new window.|
|**4**|Within the newly opened screen navigate to *Internet*(#1) **→** *Modules*(#2) within the filestructure<br> <details><summary>Click here to reveal the image</summary><img src="Media/image3.png"></details> |
|**5**|Within the webshop modules the following checkboxes need to be activated: *History invoices*(#3), *Credit application*(#4). Other checkboxes maybe left as is.<br> <details><summary>Click here to reveal the image</summary><img src="Media/image3.png"></details> |
|:memo:|*The checkbox 'History invoices (main)'(#5) may be enabled if applicable.* |

**Optional:**

Using the method in the previous steps we enabled credit for one debtor, you may want to do this for many debtors but repeating this process is too time consuming. To fix this we can only do this once but for multiple debtors at once. 

The steps below build on the previous steps:

|Step#|Explanation|
|:--|:--|
|**1**|Assuming you are on the same screen as the previous listicle's step 5, check the checkboxes listed earlier. Now press on the '*Changes to*' button (#1) this should open a new dialog window. <br> <details><summary>Click here to reveal the image</summary><img src="Media/image18.png"></details>|
|**2**|Within this dialog screen simply press the '**Ok**' button (#1)<br> <details><summary>Click here to reveal the image</summary><img src="Media/image4.png"></details>|
|**3**|This should prompt a new screen, within this screen we have 2 options: adding debtors(3.a) in groups and or multiple independent debtors(3.b) at once.<br> <details><summary>Click here to reveal the image</summary><img src="Media/image5.png"></details>|
|**3.a**|Click the '*Add debtor groups*' button (#1), this should prompt a new screen titled: 'Index Debtorgroups'. In the table select a row by clicking on it or by pressing space, you may keep pressing space to select more groups. <br><br>Something slightly more advanced is selecting inverse, this is handy when selecting everything but the current selection. To do this right click on the selection this should open a small dialog screen(#2), left click on this. This again should open a new dialog screen click on the '*Select Inverse*' option(#3).<br><br>You can also search the table if you have many groups in the table, 'Fast search'(#4) is recommended since it is way quicker than normal search especially when there are a great number of groups. If the table doesn't update automatically click on 'Refresh' (#5). <br><br>*After selecting the right debtor by groups click on the 'Ok' button(#6*)<br> <details><summary>Click here to reveal the image</summary><img src="Media/image6.png"></details> |
|**3.b**|Click the 'Select' button (#1 from step #3), this should open a new window titled:'*Index debtors*'. In the table select the debtors by clicking on it or by pressing space, you may keep pressing space to select more debtors. <br><br>Something slightly more advanced is selecting inverse, this is handy when selecting everything but the current selection. To do this right click on the selection this should open a small dialog screen(#2), left click on this. This again should open a new dialog screen click on the '*Select Inverse*' option(#3).<br><br>You can also search the table if you have many debtors in the table, 'Fast search'(#4) is recommended since it is way quicker than normal search especially when there are a great number of debtors. If the table doesn't update automatically click on 'Refresh' (#5).<br><br>You can also filter the debtors based on the group they belong to, this is done through the 'Group' dropdown(#6). When you have made the correct selection for your scenario click on the 'Ok' button (#7).<br> <details><summary>Click here to reveal the image</summary><img src="Media/image7.png"></details>|
|**4**|After having made the selection in 3.a or 3.b the table in the window titled: 'Selection debtors' should now contain the selection made(#1). For the purpose of this manual we are done on this screen so simply click the 'Ok' button. <br><br>After clicking this button the window should disappear and a message prompt should appear telling you about how many changes were made.  |

## Reasons for creating credit in Florisoft

As a supplier it is possible to make credit reasons in Florisoft. Credit reasons are reasons as to why a customer submits a credit request. These credit reasons will be visible when making a credit request from the webshop. Examples of credit reasons are broken products, wrongly supplied amount.
