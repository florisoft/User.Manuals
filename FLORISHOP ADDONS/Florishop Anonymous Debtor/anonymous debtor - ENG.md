# Manual Creating Anonymous Debtors

## Introduction

This tutorial is about creating anonymous debtors. For example, an anonymous debtor can see the stock in the shop, but not the prices. Think of it as a kind of guest account.

|Step|Explanation.

|**4**| Type in the search field **__anon__** and press **Enter** or click the **search** button (#5)
|**5**| If an anonymous debtor exists in the system it will now be displayed as a result in the list of debtors (#6)

|Step|Explanation.
|:--|:--|
|**1**| Click the **Add new item** button on the **Debtors** tab of the **Constants** window. The **Debtors window :** will open<details><summary>**Click here for the sample image**</summary><img src=".anonymous/photo3.png"></details>|.

|Step|Explanation.
|:-:|:--|
|**1**|Navigate to the **Internet** tab (#1) -> **Internet access** (#2) and check the "This customer has Internet access" (#3) and "This customer is allowed to log into Florisoft" (#4)|.
|**2**|Enter the value **ANON!** in the "Password for the customer" field (#14)<details><summary>**Click here for the sample image**</summary><img src=".anonymous/photo5.png"></details>
|**3**|Click the 'Accessible Stocks' button (#5) in the 'Debtors' window. The 'Stocks on Internet Sales' window opens. Continue reading on the next page.|
|**4**|<details><summary>**Click here for the sample image**</summary><img src=".anonymous/photo6.png"></details>|
|**5**|Tick the 'A' , 'R' & 'T' checkboxes for the stocks you want to make accessible through the webshop.<details><summary>**Click here for the sample image**</summary><img src=".anonymous/photo7.png"></details>|
|**6**|Enter "-100,000" in the "PERC" column here. This way, the anonymous debtor cannot see a price on this particular stock. That person will only see "---"

In the above example, for the stocks TEST, BLOEM, DECO and TEST17, the checkmarks "A", "R" & "T" are checked. This means that these stocks are visible to the anonymous debtor yet they can't purchase from these stocks because read only (R) is enabled.

<!-- 
The checkmark 'T' (#21) determines whether the debtor is allowed to buy through the webshop. As a rule, the anonymous debtor is never allowed to buy through the webshop.


|Step|Explanation|
|:--|:--|
|**1**| Select the checkbox 'T' for the relevant stocks. :warning:Please note that for stocks used in conjunction with WhatsApp sharing, always check boxes A and R are selected and check box T - is unchecked.
|**2**|Click 'Ok' (#1) in the 'Stocks on Internet Sales' window to confirm the changes to the stock authorization for the anonymous debtor. <details><summary>**Click here for the sample image**</summary><img src=".anonymous/photo8.png"></details>
|**3**|Click the "OK" button in the window **Debtors: ANON" to confirm all settings

<br>

The anonymous debtor has now been created with the correct settings regarding authorization
