# Manual Logging into Florisoft

Welcome to the manual for logging into Florisoft. The Florisoft application is usually running on a cloud server. That is why logging in consists out of 2 steps: logging onto the cloud server and logging onto Florisoft. These two steps are explained in the next 2 chapters.

After this introduction a chapter will follow explaining logging into the cloud server. Only autorised users can access the server. These users received a username and password during the implementation process of Florisoft.

Chapter 3 describes the process of logging into Florisoft. Here the same principles apply as it does for logging into the cloud server: only autorised users can access Florisoft using a username and password.

In chapter 4 is is described how a user can log into the webshop. These steps in the chapter are optional. Not every customer uses a webshop. The webshop has different types accounts that can log in, though the logging in process is the same for all.

The goal of this manual is to explain to Florisoft users how to log into the server, aswell as Florisoft.
