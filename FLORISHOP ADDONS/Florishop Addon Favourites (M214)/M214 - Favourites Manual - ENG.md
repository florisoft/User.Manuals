# Manual Florishop Favourites (M214)

The FloriShop addon favorites gives your customer a way to favorite articles so they can easily find the later. 

This module only works for lots with a commercial article number (CARTNR). For this, batches must have a commercial feature group that you can set up per article or article group.

**Why commercial feature groups?** *With this functionality, a customer can keep track of his favorites per grower and or length (S1) to distinguish more easily. The shop remembers the favorites per customer also with new sessions.*

**Note:** *when adding a commercial feature group to an item or item group, the CARTNRs will not be calculated retroactively. This means that only new batches in your system will have this calculated.*

Important information for setting up the module; Before setting up the module, a Florisoft employee must check whether the way of hashing goes via the new way. Please contact the support department for this.
The conversion can be done via the debug option ‘Commercial parcel hash conversion’. By default, this is enabled on systems implemented after 2020. Systems that were already live before that year will have to be converted to the new way of hashing. If this has not yet been done, please contact the support department.
