# Florisoft Handleiding FloriShield (M96)

## License

To use the florisoft monitor the license for "*Florishield*" is required. After activation in the license file, a license update has to be done in the client.

## Operation

The FloriShield consists of several parts. The normal Florisoft client where, for example, the Timer is running. If the *FloriShield* license is active and for the logged user it is checked that it is being monitored, then the **FloriShield Client** is started. In addition, a ***FloriShield Client*** is required, this is the part that the Florisoft client checks, corrects and reports.

In the future, a ***FloriShield IT Client*** and ***FloriShield Support Client*** will be added. For example, the ***FloriShield IT Client*** runs with the Florisoft application manager and displays the results and messages of multiple ***FloriShield Clients*** in its network. The ***FloriShield Support Client*** will run at Florisoft Support and will show results and notifications from multiple Florisoft customers.

## Configuration

### Florisoft client

To ensure that a Florisoft client can be monitored, this has to be enabled for the logged in user. For this, *FS-2000 FloriShield setting* has to be set to **True**.

<details><summary><b>Click here for the example image!</b></summary><img src="florishield.eng/image19.png"></details>

:warning: **Pay attention!!** :warning:

*If multiple monitors are to run on the same machine (for example a virtual machine), the port number must be different from each other*.

<details><summary><b>Click here for the example image!</b></summary><img src="florishield.eng/image18.png"></details>

> **ATTENTION:** In the DOTNET version, communication is no longer via TCP but via HTTP the Windows user running the Florishield Server must be given permissions to listen to HTTP: ```netsh http add urlacl url=http://+:8733/Design_Time_Addresses/Florisoft_Monitor_Service/MonitorService/ user=DOMAIN\Username```


## Stopping the FloriShield Client

The FloriShield Client cannot be stopped by clicking on the cross. This is done to prevent someone from accidentally stopping the FloriShield Client. If you click on the cross anyway, the FloriShield Client is minimized to the System tray and continues to check.

<details><summary><b>Click here for the example image!</b></summary><img src="florishield.eng/foto2.png"></details>

The FloriShield Client can be stopped by right clicking on the icon and choosing "Close Florisoft monitor" (This did not work on my system for some odd reason).

<details><summary><b>Click here for the example image!</b></summary><img src="florishield.eng/foto3.png"></details>

After which you have to confirm to stop the FloriShield Client.
The **FloriShield Service** stops automatically when the Florisoft Client is stopped. Stopping the Florisoft Client will take a little longer, because all connections to the **FloriShield Service** must be stopped.

## Notifications

The FloriShield Client sends various messages to Telegram users (See how to configure Telegram). These messages can be set in Florisoft's Constants under 'Financial - Invoice texts'. Texts 26 to 31 are used for sending the various messages. At this moment the translations cannot be entered yet. However, 2 variables can be set in the texts, these are {MACHINE} and {USER} where {MACHINE} is replaced by the computer name on which the Monitor Client runs and {USER} by the Florisoft username that must be active according to the settings.

## Updates

The ***FloriShield Client*** runs along with *scheduled updates*. As soon as a scheduled update is scheduled, the FloriShield Client will also pick it up, just like the Florisoft Client running on the machine in question. At the set time, both the Florisoft Client and the FloriShield Client are closed, with the difference that the FloriShield Client is instructed to restart.

*The following screen is displayed:*

<details><summary><b>Click here for the example image!</b></summary><img src="florishield.eng/foto4.png"></details>

After the scheduled update has ended, a restart of the ***FloriShield Client*** will take place, which immediately performs the update, as happens with any Florisoft Client. After the update, the ***FloriShield Client*** will restart and it will start Florisoft and the timer as part of the set controls.
