# Manual: Florisoft Workspaces on Azure

This manual explains how to configure Florisoft Workspaces.
By setting up these workspaces, you will be able to access local files within your Florisoft Azure Remote App.

## Prerequisites

To follow the steps in this manual, you will need the following:

- **Florisoft Remote App**: Your Florisoft environment must be hosted on an Azure Remote App.

- **Windows Hub-App**: This must be installed on your local Windows device. You can find installation instructions [here](https://github.com/florisoft/User.Manuals/blob/main/CLOUD%20APPLICATIONS/Hub%20App/Hub-App%20Installation%20EN.md#installing-the-windows-application).

- **Job-Agent**: A properly installed and connected Job-Agent application, started from the Hub-App, that is linked to your cloud server. Use [this manual](https://github.com/florisoft/User.Manuals/blob/main/CLOUD%20APPLICATIONS/Windows%20Job-Agent%20application/Manual%20Job-Agent%20-%20EN.md) to set up the Job-agent on your local device.

## Using Workspaces

With the configured workspace, you can access local (Windows) files from within the Florisoft Remote App.  
The steps below illustrate an example use case in Florisoft.

| **5** | After closing the Windows Explorer prompt, reopen the Job-Agent on your local device. Under **Jobs**, you will see a new task labeled **Uploading file**, with a status of **Failure**. This indicates that the system attempted to upload a file, but the upload was canceled.<details><summary><b>Click here for an example image!</b></summary><img src="Media/10.png"></details> |
