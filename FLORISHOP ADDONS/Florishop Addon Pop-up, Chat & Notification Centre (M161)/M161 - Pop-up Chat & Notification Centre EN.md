# Florisoft Manual FloriShop Addon Pop-Up Chat & Notification (M161)

This document describes the operation of the chat function in FloriShop. The idea behind this feature is that logged-in customers on the webshop can communicate directly with their account manager (salesperson). The salesperson, of course, has the option to chat "back" to the customer. In practice, it often happens that customers want some more information about a product before making a purchase. The chat function within the webshop plays an important role in this.

Florisoft employees should already have gone through the Florisoft system settings before you start with this manual. The same applies to the Florishop settings regarding the use of the chat function.

## Creating Debtor groups

*Because the chat function is built on top of the Sales add on, it is necessary to divide the debtors who will use the chat function into debtor groups. The idea behind this is that each salesperson is responsible for contacting x number of customers. All customers belonging to a salesperson should be grouped into a debtor group.<br><br> go through the following steps:*

|Step|Explanation|
|:--|:--|
|**1**| In the constants, navigato the the following path: **Community -> Debtor data -> Debtor groups.**
|**2**| Create a new debtor group here by pressing the plus sign. Then enter an appropriate description here.
|**3**| In the following table, select all debtors who are part of the group.<details><summary><b>Click here for the example image</b></summary><img src=".Pop-up Chat & Notification Centre EN/image1.png"></details>|
|**4**| Save the new group

## Setting up sales reps for the chat function

To use the chat function, it is important that the salespeople are properly set up and have access to the webshop. This requires setting up some interconnections between debtors and system users. Below is a simple representation on how this is done.

## Creating a webshop sales debtor

*Since, from a technical point of view, only debtors can log into the webshop, a separate debtor is needed, which is linked to the seller in the next step. In turn, the salesperson will later be linked to the salesperson's system user. Below is an overall roadmap for creating a sales debtor. <br><br>A sales debtor is technically nothing more than a 'normal' Florisoft debtor. Other names for a webshop sales debtor are: webshop sales debtor, sales debtor or sales debtor.*

:warning: **Please note:** each salesperson must be associated with its own sales debtor. So one salesperson also means one sales debtor. Two salesmen also means two sales debtors in the system. In other words: the number of sales debtors must equal the number of sales representatives.

**Go through the following steps:**
|Step|Explanation|
|:--|:--|
|**1**| In the constants, navigate to the path: **Community-> Debtor data-> Debtors**
