### Purpose

This manual describes a solution to get scanning working again on the **Skorpio X5** until a permanent solution has been implemented in the code.

---

## When to apply

- Scanning does not work or is unreliable in the app

- Applies to Skorpio X5 devices

- Temporary workaround until the software solution is ready


---

## Step-by-step plan

1. **Open the _Datalogic_ app** on the Skorpio.
    
2. Go to **Datalogic Settings**.
    
3. Open **Scanner Settings**.
    
4. Select **Wedge**.
    
5. Scroll down slightly and enable **Enable intent wedge**.
    
6. Go back one menu.
    
7. Scroll all the way down and press **Commit**.  
    ⚠️ **Please note:** this step is crucial.  
    If you do not press **Commit**, the settings will **not be saved**.
    
8. Close the settings.
    
9. **Restart the app**.


After restarting, scanning should work correctly again.
