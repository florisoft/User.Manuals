# Updating the Cloud Server

This document describes the process of updating the Florisoft cloud server.

Before we start, it is important to know that your Florisoft backoffice and cloud server versions are not too far part. 
Having many different versions between the two can cause unexpected and unwanted behaviour. It is recommended that when possible the cloud server and backoffice
are updated simultaneously. If this is not possible try to update your backoffice within two weeks.

On default a new cloudserver is downloaded when updating the backoffice; you will still need to install/update the downloaded cloud server update.
You can also choose to download the cloud server independently and then update it seperately as well.

Before you update the cloud server do make sure there are no users actively using the cloud server's functionalities, if need be disconnect the users.
