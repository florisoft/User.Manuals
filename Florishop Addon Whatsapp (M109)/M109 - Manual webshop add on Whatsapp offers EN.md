# Preface

Welcome the Florishop WhatsApp offers manual. Sending offers via
WhatsApp to customers is a beautiful way to bring products from the
webshop to the attention of customers. With the wide availability of
smartphones and tablet PC’s this add on can ensure a higher turnover
from the webshop.

The first step in setting up this add-on is to set up a so-called
anonymous debtor. This is done in Florisoft and is described in chapter
two. This chapter also describes the authorization settings for the
anonymous debtor. These settings are important for the behavior and
visibility of stocks on the webshop.

Chapter three shows the steps for linking the anonymous debtor to the
webshop, so the WhatsApp functionality becomes activated.

The manual describes two ways WhatsApp can be used in relation to the
webshop. The first way is to send full stocks. This is widely used for
stocks with daily offers. The second way of sharing offers via WhatsApp
consists of sending individual products. Both ways are described in
chapter four.

The last chapter, chapter five, gives an overview of other available
webshop add ons. The webshop can be extended with a large number of
other add ons, each with its own functionality. We would like to
introduce you to this add ons.

The goal of this manual is to show how to use WhatsApp offers in the
webshop so your products are always on top of the customers mind.

**Pay attention: images in this manual may slightly differ from what you
see on your own screen.**

# Creating an anonymous debtor in Florisoft

An anonymous debtor is required to share stocks/parcels via WhatsApp.
The anonymous debtor is a webshop user who has access to the webshop,
but is limited in terms of possibilities. For example, an anonymous
debtor may not buy. Below is how the creation of an anonymous debtor
works.

**Please note: creating an anonymous debtor is only necessary if it does
not already exist.**

1.  Open the 'Constants' in Florisoft by clicking on the icon below:

<img src=".Manual webshop add on Whatsapp offers\media\image2.png" style="width:2.43784in;height:0.7501in" />

1.  Open the Debtors tab via Community (no. 1) -&gt; Debtors (no. 2)

2.  Click once in the column 'Deb. nr.’ (no. 3)

> <img src=".Manual webshop add on Whatsapp offers\media\image3.png" style="width:5.69792in;height:3.05766in" />

1.  Type in the search field 'anon' (without quotes) and press Enter or
    click on the 'Search' button (no. 5)

2.  If an anonymous debtor already exists in the system, it is now
    displayed as a result in the list of debtors. (no. 6) Go further to
    step 10.

If no anonymous debtor is found, go to step 6 on the next page.

1.  Click the 'Add new item' button on the 'Debtors' tab of the
    'Constants' window. The 'Debtors:' window opens.

<img src=".Manual webshop add on Whatsapp offers\media\image4.png" style="width:5.76042in;height:1.82479in" />

1.  On the 'Addresses' tab in the 'Debtors :’ window, enter the
    following information:

<img src=".Manual webshop add on Whatsapp offers\media\image5.png" style="width:5.75464in;height:1.07639in" />

7 = ANON, 8 = ANON and 9 = Anonymous debtor

Read more on the next page.

1.  Navigate to the tab 'Internet' (no. 10), Internet access (no. 11)
    and check the boxes 'This customer has access by means Internet'
    (no. 12) and 'This client can log in Webshop 3.' (no. 13)

2.  Enter the ANON! value in the 'Password for customer' field in.
    (no. 14)

<img src=".Manual webshop add on Whatsapp offers\media\image6.png" style="width:5.74336in;height:4.95833in" />

Click the ‘Accessible stocks’ button (no. 15) to open the authorization
settings for the available stocks and/or order lists in the system. Read
more on the next page.

The steps below describes the authorization settings for the anonymous
debtor and stocks.

1.  Click the ‘Accessible stocks’ button (no. 15) to open the ‘Raises by
    Sale through the Internet window.

2.  Check if the column ‘Perc’ is visible by right clicking one of the
    existing columns. (no. 16) Now a window pops up with all the
    available columns for the ‘Raises by Sale through the Internet’.

<img src=".Manual webshop add on Whatsapp offers\media\image7.png" style="width:5.83333in;height:4.73315in" />

1.  Check if there is a tick in the ‘Aan’ column for the ‘Perc’ column.
    If not, put the tick on. If the tick is already on, the ‘Perc’
    column is already visible.

2.  Click the ‘Ok’ button (no. 18) in the bottom right corner of the
    columns screen.

Now the column becomes visible in the ‘Raises by Sale through the
Internet’ screen. It is possible that the ‘Perc’ column is stated as the
last column to the right.

Use the horizontal scroll bar to make the column visible. Click on the
name of the column and hold down the left mouse button. Press the Ctrl
key simultaneously and drag the column to the desired position.

1.  Fill in the value -100 in the ‘Perc’ column (no. 19) for the stocks
    you want to be able to share via WhatsApp. This ensures that the
    anonymous debtor doesn’t see prices on the webshop.

2.  Put the ‘A’ and ‘R’ ticks (no. 20) on for the stocks you want to
    have accessible on the webshop.

In the example below the stocks TEST, TEST17 and 777 have the ‘A’ and
‘R’ columns ticked. This means that those stocks are visible for the
anonymous debtor.

1.  Uncheck ‘T’ tick (no. 21) for the concerning stocks. This means that
    the anonymous debtor is not possible to buy from these stocks.

>
> **Pay attention: for the stocks used in combination with WhatsApp
> offers, be sure that the ‘A’, ‘R’ and ‘T’ ticks are checked.**

1.  Click the ‘OK’ button (no. 22) in the ‘Raises by Sale through the
    Internet’ to confirm the changes to the stock authorization for the
    anonymous debtor.

In the stock you have the option to send a complete stock or an
individual article. The steps 3 up and till 6 works the same for stocks
and articles.

<img src=".Manual webshop add on Whatsapp offers\media\image19.jpeg" style="width:2.33333in;height:4.14815in" alt="cid:image012.jpg@01D3651A.BC7510A0" />

<img src=".Manual webshop add on Whatsapp offers\media\image20.jpeg" style="width:2.48958in;height:4.43359in" alt="cid:image005.jpg@01D3651B.28D61F00" />
