Do not place the extracted files in the downloads folder or any folder that is regularly accessed by other applications.|

:warning: Keep in mind that a user that is logged in on the Hub-app cannot be used to log into other apps. It is possible to force the user to log out of the Hub-app, this is not advisable. Best practice is to create a specific user to log in to the Hub-app and have a seperate user for the other apps, this way the apps don't block each other out.

After the Hub-app is installed other apps can be downloaded, installed and used.

It is important that the Hub-app is not uninstalled from your terminal as the other Florisoft apps are managed through the app. The Hub app is also vital to update the apps when new versions become available.
