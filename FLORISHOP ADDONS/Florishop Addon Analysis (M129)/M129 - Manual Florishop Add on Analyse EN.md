# Florisoft Manual Florishop Add-on Analysis(M129)

Welcome to the manual Analysis for the Florishop. This add on gives users (mainly admins and commerce employees) insights in the behaviour of customers on their webshop.

This add-on works with Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager. Both are free services that Google offers in order to give insights into web application data using all sorts of graphs, diagrams, KPI's and other statistical indicators. These elements are presented on a dashboard so that all the information is visible on a glance at the dashboard.

**The idea of this manual is that you the reader have already setup the Google Analytics or Tag manager environment. This manual only covers the necessary settings on the Florishop.**

:warning: **With Google Analytics you might collect privacy sensitive data of the webshop users. You will need to make sure that this is compliant with your local/national privacy laws (e.g. GDPR for EU citizens). Florisoft is not liable for any legal action that comes from violating privacy laws.**:warning:
