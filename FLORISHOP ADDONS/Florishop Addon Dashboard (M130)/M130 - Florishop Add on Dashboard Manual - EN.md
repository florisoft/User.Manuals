## Setting up CMS zones

CMS zones are so-called 'labels' that are assigned to debtors and webshop pages in order to manage which debtors see which pages. A debtor with a label/CMS zone assigned will see all pages that also have this label/CMS zone. Pages without a CMS zone/label are visible to everyone, unless otherwise indicated in the visibility of the page. A visualization of this can be found below:

<details open><summary><b>Click here for the example image!</b></summary><img src=".Dashboard Handleiding\media EN\image1.png"></details>

This chapter talks about the creation of CMS zones and configuring webshop pages with these CMS zones. By setting a CMS zone on a certain page, you are able to hide it from all users except the users who have the same CMS zone assigned. Assigning CMS zones to users will be discussed in the next chapter.

|**5**|Click on the plus sign in the Filtertoolbar to show the various filters that are available.<details><summary><b>Click here for the example image!</b></summary><img src=".Dashboard Handleiding\media EN\image34.png"></details> |

The following filters are available in the FilterToolbar component:

- [Query filter](#query-filters)
    - Make a selection using an SQL query to filter data.

- [PresetValueFilter](#preset-value-filter)
    - Filter the data using predetermined data.

- [QueryFilterDate](#query-filter-date)
    - Filter the data using a extendable calendar to select date ranges to fitler the data.

In [this chapter](#the-use-of-filters) you can read how to use these filters.

:memo: Multiple filters can be added to the same FilterToolBar.

## Query filters

|Step|Explanation|
|:-:|:--|
|**1**|Add a query filter using the green plus sign.<details><summary><b>Click here for the example image!</b></summary><img src=".Dashboard Handleiding\media EN\image35.png"></details>|
|**2**|Add a Keyword name and label(#1), make sure these apptly describe the Keyword in the description field. You can also give it a default value and decide if the keyword accepts multiple values.<details><summary><b>Click here for the example image!</b></summary><img src=".Dashboard Handleiding\media EN\image38.png"></details>|
|**3**|Add a query to the SQL query editor, to do this click on the white field or green button. **Make sure that the query returns one column!**|
|**4**|Before saving your query, you need to validate it. You can do this by clicking on the green button with the checkmark (#1). If the query can be executed, a message will be displayed (#2). If the query cannot be executed, you will receive an error message on the screen. Only when the query is working, you can save it.<details><summary><b>Click here for the example image!</b></summary><img src=".Dashboard Handleiding\media EN\image19.png"></details><br>:warning:**Make sure that your queries do not take longer than 1500ms**|

If the Query filter is set up correctly, the dropdown can be used to create a selection. The image below shows an example of it working on debtor numbers.

<details><summary><b>Click here for the example image!</b></summary><img src=".Dashboard Handleiding\media EN\image39.png"></details>


### Preset value filter

|Step|Explanation|
|:-:|:--|
|**1**|Add a PresetValueFilter to the FilterToolbar using the green plus sign.<details><summary><b>Click here for the example image!</b></summary><img src=".Dashboard Handleiding\media EN\image36.png"></details>|
|**2**|Add a Keyword name and label, make sure these apptly describe their functionalities. Give the filter a default value and if a user can enter multiple values in to the filter.<details><summary><b>Click here for the example image!</b></summary><img src=".Dashboard Handleiding\media EN\image40.png"></details>|
|**3**|Navigate to the 'Waardes' or 'Values' tab (#4).|
|**4**|In the tab 'Values' or 'Waardes' you'll need to add all your PresetValue. Add an item (#1), enter a name(#2) and value(#3).<details><summary><b>Click here for the example image!</b></summary><img src=".Dashboard Handleiding\media EN\image41.png"></details><br>:bulb: The name is the visual display of the value. In this screen you can create a descriptive name for otherwise more cryptic code.<details><summary><b>Click here for the example image!</b></summary><img src=".Dashboard Handleiding\media EN\image42.png"></details>|

If the PresetValueFilter is set correctly the dropdown can now be used to make a selection. The example image below in combination with the previous image gives a good insight in how the filter works.
<details><summary><b>Click here for the example image!</b></summary><img src=".Dashboard Handleiding\media EN\image43.png"></details>

### Query filter date

|Step|Explanation|
|:-:|:--|
|**1**|Add the query filter to the filter toolbar using the green plus sign.<details><summary><b>Click here for the example image!</b></summary><img src=".Dashboard Handleiding\media EN\image37.png"></details>|
|**2**|Give the QueryFilterDate a name and label(#1) and set a default value(#2). The default value can be a regular date (YYYYMMDD) or '=today'. This makes it so that the standard value of this filter is always the current date. <br><Br>You can also add or remove days from the '=today' value by using + X or - X e.g. =today+1.<details><summary><b>Click here for the example image!</b></summary><img src=".Dashboard Handleiding\media EN\image44.png"></details>|

If the QueryFilterDate is set up correctly the dropdown should now show a selection in a calendar element.

<details><summary><b>Click here for the example image!</b></summary><img src=".Dashboard Handleiding\media EN\image45.png"></details>

### The use of filters

After setting up a filter they need to be used in the SQL queries behind the dashboard components. This needs to be done in the 'WHERE' part of the SQL query. You can refer to the filters by using the given Keyword naam, which needs to be in between ##. 

In the situation below we will use a graph as an example. If we want to change the date range using filters we need to use two QueryFilterDate filers. The keywords for these filters are 'DatumVan' (From Date) and 'DatumTot' (Till Date)

```sql
where date_variable >= '#DateFrom#'
    and date_variable <= '#DateTill#'
```

:bulb: '#Keywordnaam#' gets replaced by the value of the selection, for example: '2023-01-11'

When using the PresetValueFilter mulitple values are possible, you can fix this by doing the following:

```sql
where variable in ('#attribute1#', '#attribute2#')
```

If you want to use multiple variables sepereate them with coma's in the parenthesis.

:bulb: Apostrophs ('') are only necessary when the parameters (variables) are strings or dates. Do not use '' with numeric datatypes like floats or integers.
