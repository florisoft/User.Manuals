# Florisoft Update

### 1. Why do I need to perform an update?
An update of Florisoft is necessary when you have requested an adjustment within Florisoft (or Florisoft deems this adjustment necessary) and Florisoft has informed you that this adjustment is ready to be delivered.

### 2. How do I perform an update?
Follow these steps to start the update:

1. Start the `Florisoft Update shortcut`.<br><br>

> **Why update via a separate Florisoft shortcut?**<br>
This way, you only download the new Florisoft version onto a separate Florisoft client. The advantage of this approach is that you can test the new version without other users immediately logging into the latest version. If there are issues with the new version, everyone can continue working on the old version until the update is rolled out to all users.
<br><br>
If you do not yet have a `Florisoft Update shortcut` on your desktop, please contact our support department by email or phone to schedule setup.

2. Right-click on the `Florisoft Leaves icon` in the Navigator.

3. Choose the option `Internet Update System`.<br><br>

> With this type of purge, it is not necessary to log out system users or stop the webshop. This allows you to update the version without affecting other system users and the accessibility of the webshop.<br><br>
You can update the webshop and CloudServer at a later time. We recommend doing this on the same day at a suitable time.<br><br>
Instructions on how to update the webshop and CloudServer will be explained later in this document.

4. Choose `Start Online Purge`. If the online purge was successful, you will receive the following message:<br><br>

### 4. Was the update successful?
To check if the update was successful, click with the left mouse button on the `Florisoft Leaves icon` in the Navigator. You will see a date on the screen. Depending on the time of the update, this will be a recent date.

From Monday to Thursday, a new version of Florisoft is released online every morning at 08:00 (Dutch time). If you update from Monday to Thursday, you will see today's date on this screen. If you update on Friday, you will see the date from the previous day on this screen.
